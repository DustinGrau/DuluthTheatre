This ensures the house can still deliver sufficient range even without the floor speakers in use. 2 The primary purpose of the floor speakers is to reinforce low-end frequencies which are missing from the house speakers. Therefore, a low-pass filter at 120Hz ensures they avoid competing with the house audio. 3 Due to a mild spike around 94Hz in the theatre a minor reduction in that frequency is necessary to avoid reverberation. 4 The distance between the house speakers (on-wall) and the floor speakers (on the apron) is approximately 10ft. This equates to a needed delay of ~9.8ms to ensure proper timing. Should this change, take measurements using a laser measure from various locations on each side of the audience. Calculate the delay as ((Distance to Wall Speaker - Distance to Floor Speaker) / 1125) * 1000 where distance is in feet and 1,125 ft/sec. is the speed of sound. This will give you a delay in milliseconds. Average your calculations to get a suitable delay. \ud83d\udca1 Mains handle mids and highs, floors handle low-end reinforcement.

It connects to the general network hosted in the booth for the lighting and mixer consoles. Bandwidth The network depends on a 1 gigabit (1Gbps) connection which should be more than sufficient for the expected number of IP cameras and Dante audio devices to be used. It uses Quality of Service (QoS) and Multicast (IGMP) management features to ensure data is delivered in a timely and organized manner. Estimated 30Mbps or less for Dante Audio from the Tio1608-D stagebox Estimated 8Mbps per IP camera at 1080p@60fps (NDI-HX, H.264) Estimated 15Mbps for return stream at 1080p@30fps (H.265) Estimated 5-10Mbps for control and overhead VLAN Assignments A Virtual LANs, or VLAN , represents a dedicated environment in which network traffic can be isolated. This is extremely useful for certain types of traffic such as Dante Audio which has strict requirements to ensure data is delivered on-time and with top priorit. Meanwhile, other traffic such as video distribution can be considered \"noisy\" and may impede delivery of time-sensitive data. Think of a VLAN as an express lane on the highway, where you can only enter and exit at certain points (ports), and you may have a special \"toll pass\" to allow you to use that lane (Port VLAN ID, or PVID ). These are the VLANs associated with the complete AV network: VLAN Name Description DHCP Managed? 1 Management Default network for the booth equipment Yes, by R7000 3 Auto-Video Built-in Netgear VLAN for audio-video No, static IPs only 10 Distribution Broadcasting network for HDMI over IP No, static IPs only These VLANs will be assigned within each network switch by either a Tagged (T) or Untagged (U) status on each port. This allows the port to identify traffic using the special \"toll pass\" (PVID) for each \"toll lane\" (VLAN). The following guidelines should help to make this more clear: When a port is Untagged (U) it means that any traffic may travel in that VLAN. By default, any traffic which does not have a VLAN ID will be assumed to be VLAN 1. When a port is Tagged (T) id means that any traffic which belongs to that VLAN is allowed to move across that port. Only 1 VLAN may be Untagged for any given port, but many VLANs may be Tagged for a port. A port which contains both Untagged and multiple Tagged VLANs is considered a trunk port . If a port is neither Untagged nor Tagged , it is essentially closed for any traffic. For an Untagged port, specifying a PVID means to apply that VLAN ID to all egress (outbound) traffic. In the following switch configurations, there are 2 trunk ports to allow the switches to connect to each other. By convention port #1 is used as the uplink between the tech booth switch and backstage switch. IP Addresses In order for devices to speak to each other they must also utilize an IP address which can be automatically assigned (DHCP) or manually assigned (Static), and these values use a specific prefix for common address space which identifies a network range consisting of 4 groups of numbers (quads). In continuing the analogy of vehicles and toll lanes, think of this as the license plate for a vehicle: The first 2 \"quads\" represent the network range (eg. \"192.168\"). Think of this as the state that issued the license plate. By convention we use a 3rd quad for a \"subnet\" matching the VLAN. Think of this as the county in the state which issued the license plate. The final number (4th quad) in the IP address identifies a device within the subnet. And just like a license plate every IP address must be unique for each device! In addition to an IP address each device uses a Subnet Mask which is a value that says what networks can talk to other networks. For the case of this network we only want devices on the same subnet to speak with each other so we use a common default of 255.255.255.0 which means only devices which share the first 3 quads of their address can speak to each other under normal conditions. The only other way devices can talk across networks is to introduce a router or \"gateway\" which is aware of other networks and how to reach them. In the case of the AV network only the devices which belong to the Management (default) VLAN will use a gateway, which is the IP address of the R7000 router : 192.168.1.1 . Special Note: For our Dante Audio devices, these have a special fallback protocol called \"Link-Local\". In the absence of a static IP assignment, and no available DHCP server to dynamically assign an IP address, the devices will self-negotiate their IP address among themselves. This uses a special network range 169.254.0.0 through 169.254.255.255 and so this space must be kept clear of any other devices to avoid conflict.

This uses a special network range 169.254.0.0 through 169.254.255.255 and so this space must be kept clear of any other devices to avoid conflict.","title":"IP Addresses"},{"location":"network-av/#wifi-access","text":"For information about WiFi access, connections for the audio mixer and ETC console, please see the General Network page.","title":"WiFi Access"},{"location":"network-av/#netgear-gs748tv4h2","text":"Location: Tech Booth Switch IP: 192.168.1.6 (VLAN 1: Management Network) VLAN Tagging: V# = [T]agged or [U]ntagged Port V1 V3 V10 PVID Name/Purpose Device IP Notes. 1 U T T 1 Trunk Port Uplink to GS716T 2 U 1 Netgear Router 192.168.1.1 Uplink to R7000 3 U 3 Yamaha NY64-D Link-Local Dante Audio 4 U 3 Booth iMac 192.168.3.50 OBS, Video Output 5 U 3 - Available - 6 U 3 - Available - 7 U 3 - Available - 8 U 3 - Available - 9 U 3 Booth (USB) 192.168.3.110 AVer PTZ310 10 U 3 Booth (NDI) 192.168.3.120 AVer PTZ300N 11 U 3 - Available - 12 U 3 - Available - 13 U 3 - Available - 14 U 3 - Available - 15 U 3 - Available - 16 U 3 - Available - 17 U 3 - Available - 18 U 3 - Available - 19 U 3 - Available - 20 U 3 - Available - 21 U 3 - Available - 22 U 3 - Available - 23 U 3 - Available - 24 U 3 - Available - 25 U 3 - Available - 26 U 3 - Available - 27 U 3 - Available - 28 U 3 - Available - 29 U 3 - Available - 30 U 3 - Available - 31 U 3 - Available - 32 U 3 - Available - 33 U 3 - Available - 34 U 3 - Available - 35 U 3 - Available - 36 U 3 - Available - 37 U 3 - Available - 38 U 3 - Available - 39 U 3 - Available - 40 U 3 - Available - 41 U 3 - Available - 42 U 3 - Available - 43 U 10 Blackbird TX 192.168.10.10 HDMI Signal Out 44 U 10 HDMI over IP HDMI Stream Only 45 U 10 HDMI over IP HDMI Stream Only 46 U 10 HDMI over IP HDMI Stream Only 47 U T 1 Admin Access Internet + Video 48 U T 1 Admin Access Internet + Video 49 SFP - Not Used 50 SFP - Not Used","title":"Netgear GS748Tv4h2"},{"location":"network-av/#netgear-gs716tv3","text":"Location: Backstage (Right) Switch IP: 192.168.1.8 (VLAN 1: Management Network) VLAN Tagging: V# = [T]agged or [U]ntagged Port V1 V3 V10 PVID Name/Purpose.

The analog board would not be able to keep up with the significant changes between scenes and we wanted to use more advanced features as found on a modern mixing console. More details about scenes can be found in the show's scene notes page . Recording Output Mix In order to provide a clean signal to record the show (as needed for the Shuler adjudication performance) we must have a dedicated signal using both left and right stereo signals, downmixed to mono. This can be easily accomplished with the TF-5 using a Matrix output. Select the GROUPS button beside INPUT 1 and INPUT 2 buttons on the console (above the Master fader). Select Matrix 1 from the 4 matrix outputs. Select the SEND FROM button on Matrix 1 . Turn off all channels except Stereo L and Stereo R . Set the volume for both Stereo outputs to unity (or -2dB). Make sure the matrix is configured as mono (no stereo paired). Make sure the matrix is post-fader (default when from master). Assign Matrix 2 to an unused OMNI output for recording use (13). Repeat steps 2-4 to create a Matrix 2 . Assign Matrix 1 to an unused OMNI output for lobby output (14). Custom Fader Bank Normally, the TF-5 would allow you to mix channels 1-32 plus the Main mix while on the INPUT 1 view. But with using DCAs we need a more comprehensive console surface. The TF-5 allows you to create your own custom fader bank, which can consist of any channels and DCA groups in a single view across the mixer. For this show it was useful to show all available mic'd actors as well as the DCAs they may be assigned into, and the fader for the music source (laptop). Press the INPUT 2 and OUTPUT buttons Select all desired channels and DCAs Aux Busses We commonly utilize 2 AUX busses for monitors. AUX 1 is the stage monitors while typically AUX 3 is the wing monitors. For this show we needed to switch the stagebox backstage to be UNIT 2 so our output for the wing monitors was moved to AUX 9/10. Bottom line: same idea, just slightly different output. For sake of clarity we can just think of the AUX busses as just STAGE MONITORS and WING MONITORS. AUX 1 - Stage Monitors Set the MAIN level around 0dB (Unity) for this AUX output to synchronize with the house at 0dB. Set ONLY the channel with music (laptop) to output to this AUX as Post-Fader (turn off PRE). Set the music channel 32 to +10dB so that it stays ABOVE the house level's output for music. Volume to this AUX output will follow the fader, keeping it in sync with loudness in the house.

Keep the channel with music (laptop) to output to this AUX as PRE-fader to allow direct control. Set the music channel 32 to around -20dB so that it stays constant and BELOW the stage monitors. This should ONLY be used with the Balcony Scene to avoid music bleed during other music fades! The balcony monitor will be patched to OUTPUT 1 on the stagebox (currently AUX 7 as UNIT 2). AUX 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 M VOLUME -20 0 AUX 9/10 - Wing Monitors Set the MAIN level around -10dB for this AUX output so actors in the wings can still hear the stage. Set the channel with music (laptop) to output to this AUX as Post-Fader (turn off PRE). Set all mic'd actor channels to this AUX as Post-Fader (turn off PRE). Set the music channel to 0dB so that it has no +/- adjustments, and actors get full volume. Set all actor mics to -5dB to keep the music channel more pronounced. Add an EQ to the mix to reduce lower frequencies and increase higher frequencies (emphasizes voices). Volume to this AUX output will follow all faders, keeping the overall mix intact. The wing monitors will be patched to OUTPUT 3 on the stagebox (currently AUX 9 as UNIT 2). AUX 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 M VOLUME -5 -5 -5 -5 -5 -5 -5 -5 -5 -5 -5 -5 -5 -5 -5 -5 -5 -5 0 0 Channel Assignments This is the most critical piece of planning audio for a show as this is the \"source of truth\" for the actors to know which mic is theirs, and keeps consistency which is absolutely necessary for scenes. In this case we needed all available wireless mic receivers to be available, even though we could not provide a headset mic to every named character. The choice of wireless mic was also carefuly chosen to maximize quality/reliability for pricipal actors, followed by supporting actors, and lastly ensemble members. Key: WL# = QLXD4 (1-10) Highest quality mic system, operates on a distinct frequency band. Reserved primarily for heavy dialog/singing roles. WMIC# = SLX4 (1-10, 11-16, 17) Mid-quality mic system, with potential overlap from outside radio sources. Mics 11-16 belong to a mobile \"cart\" and use distinct group/channel bands. Mics 1-10 & 17 are part of the house system and use auto-assigned channels. TIP: Turn on all available receivers/transmitters before using auto-assignment.

But when unmuted we need a standard volume for each actor so that when mixed via DCA we are simply applying an adjustment to that level. In order to make the DCA become the \"source of truth\" we need EVERY USED channel set to 0dB (unity) so there is no +/- adjustment to the original actor's level. For mic check, you can simply turn on the channel manually, set the fader to 0dB, and adjust the gain to achieve the proper volume for the actor. With the channel at unity this means the actor's most powerful voice should be close to but not above the center GREEN bar on the gain display. Once an actor is at their desired gain and unity, push the volume to +10dB to test for feedback--if you get a ringing or hum then back off of the gain slightly. This will give you a usable range above the norm to boost the actor when needed, while avoiding the point where they may get feedback.

In order to make the DCA become the \"source of truth\" we need EVERY USED channel set to 0dB (unity) so there is no +/- adjustment to the original actor's level. For mic check, you can simply turn on the channel manually, set the fader to 0dB, and adjust the gain to achieve the proper volume for the actor. With the channel at unity this means the actor's most powerful voice should be close to but not above the center GREEN bar on the gain display. Once an actor is at their desired gain and unity, push the volume to +10dB to test for feedback--if you get a ringing or hum then back off of the gain slightly. This will give you a usable range above the norm to boost the actor when needed, while avoiding the point where they may get feedback.

This allows creation of cues for audio mixing just as we use cues for lighting changes in or between scenes. All actors who must or should be mic'd must first be established on the basis of importance and presence, deprioritizing those who have fewer speaking lines or may not need a microphone, especially if there are not enough mics or headsets to go around. This should be done first to create a channel list by actor/role such as the chart see on the primary audio page for this show . From there, individual actors can be assigned into a DCA (1-8) or even groups of actors can be combined--all dynamically! What is a DCA? In short, a DCA (or Digitally Controlled Amplifier) can be a single actor or a group of actors, all controlled by a single fader. These groups can be adjusted as a whole using the fader or even muted entirely by turning off the group. However, static assignments means limited control and a need to balance both the individual actors with the group assignments. To make these more effective, TheatreMix dynamically reassigns these DCAs dynamically using the mixing console's Ethernet/WiFi capabilities. Some notes when using DCA groups: Volume is additive when using DCAs. If a channel is at -5 and a DCA fader is at -10, the sum total for that channel would be -15. Think of it as applying a percentage to a percentage, where the individual channel is the \"ceiling\" or safe maximum volume before feedback begins. You MUST NOT assign any single fader to more than 1 DCA group. This can lead to unexpected volume levels if the individual channel and the DCA groups which use it are set to different levels. Also, muting of any DCA group with that channel will mute it entirely, even if the channel or another DCA group is active. Individual channels and DCA groups can both be given an EQ or Compressor. The benefit of using compression on a group is to ensure that all members of the DCA group are kept within range, while compression on an individual channel ensures that person in isolation is kept within range for their performance. When in the Groups view, the individual members are displayed to the left when a DCA group is selected. This allows access to both the group volume as a whole as well as the mic'd actors, avoiding the need for \"chasing faders\". Also allowis time to turn off individual channels. To access DCA groups and assign channels manually: Press both INPUT1 + INPUT2 to access Groups. Select a group channel and press \"DCA Assign\" on the menu screen.

HDMI Streaming/Distribution Monoprice Blackbird H.265 Video Extender/Splitter over IP with HDMI Using the VLC program open a Network stream to one of the following paths: rtsp://192.168.10.10/live/main/av_stream rtsp://192.168.10.10/live/sub/av_stream Receiver units will automatically assign themselves an IP address, typically starting at 192.168.10.11 and increments by 1 for each additional device. Streaming with OBS Open Broadcast Studio is a powerful and FREE application used by many vloggers streamers across the internet. The interface is powerful though it takes some use to get familiar with the capabilities. Thankfully, given it's ubiquitious nature online there is no shortage of videos on both basics and advanced topics. Software Requirements Open Broadcast Studio (OBS): https://obsproject.com/download (v32+) NDI Tools: https://ndi.video/tools/ (macOS Ventura or later) Use the NDI Video Monitor from the NDI Tools to select and view the stream to test access. OBS NDI Library/Runtime: https://github.com/DistroAV/DistroAV/releases https://github.com/DistroAV/DistroAV/wiki/1.-Installation#required---ndi-runtime Homebrew can install both \"distroav\" and \"libndi\" (NDI runtime), see below.

Create new scenes which then use the camera scenes directly, eg. \"2x2 Grid\": Add each camera scene to the new scene (essentially \"nested scenes\"). Right-click \u2014> Transform \u2014> Edit Transform (resolution: 960x540) Arrange as desired (dragging or using offset parameters via Transform) HDMI Video Output In order to get a video feed from OBS you must use a Mini-DisplayPort to HDMI adapter with the iMac, and select Full Screen Projector from the OBS menu (right-click in the preview screen for options). This will treat the HDMI output as a second monitor with a full-screen preview of the live feed shown in the OBS interface. Note: HDMI output from the iMac typically adds HDCP (HD Copy Protection) to the signal which CANNOT be propagated through the Blackbird devices. In order to bypass this a special HDMI splitter is used to help \"strip\" the HDCP from the HDMI signal. This works by leveraging a known issue with some cheap splitters which improperly implement HDCP and therefore acts as a \"HDCP Bypass\" and allows the transcoding device to get a clean signal that it can propagate. NDI Streaming Output If needed, the DistroAV plugin for OBS allows you to enable NDI output directly, without need for a separate streaming configuration. Once enabled, NDI output begins immediately.
