# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Duluth Theatre Documentation Project

## Project Overview
This is a documentation project that uses GitHub Pages to publish content to a documentation portal. The primary focus is creating, maintaining, and organizing documentation rather than application development.

## Content Guidelines
- Write clear, concise documentation in Markdown format
- Use proper heading hierarchy (H1 for page titles, H2-H6 for sections)
- Include table of contents for longer documents
- Add descriptive alt text for images
- Use consistent formatting and style throughout

## File Structure
- Keep documentation files organized in logical directories
- Use lowercase filenames with hyphens for spaces (e.g., `user-guide.md`)
- All pages should reside under a `docs/` directory
- Place images in an `images/` directory within `docs/`
- Maintain an `index.md` as the main entry point

## GitHub Pages Best Practices
- Use Jekyll front matter when needed for page metadata
- Test links and ensure they work in the GitHub Pages environment
- Optimize images for web delivery
- Consider mobile responsiveness for documentation layout

## Writing Style
- Use active voice when possible
- Write for the target audience (theatre staff, volunteers, patrons)
- Include practical examples and step-by-step instructions
- Keep sentences and paragraphs reasonably short for readability

## Maintenance
- Regular review and updates of outdated information
- Consistent naming conventions for files and folders
- Proper use of Git commit messages for documentation changes
