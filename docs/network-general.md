# General Network

The tech booth is outfitted with a dedicated wireless network which allows access to the audio and lighting equipment via mobile and desktop computers. This affords students the ability to learn tools like the [Yamaha TF Stagemix](https://usa.yamaha.com/products/proaudio/software/tfstagemix/index.html) for iOS to wirelessly manage the audio mixer from backstage or within the house. For lighting, students can learn the Eos software with use of the [ETCnomad USB Key](https://www.etcconnect.com/ETCnomad/) to design and manage cues while acting as a remote console.

## WiFi Router - Netgear R7000

This is a private network which can access the internet through the DHS network, and is still subject to rules and protections put in place by GCPS. This is not meant to be used directly by the student body so passwords have been purposefully removed.
